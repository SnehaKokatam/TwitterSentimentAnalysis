# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether the data is positive,negative or neutral.In this project, I created a twitter developer account, extracted all the tweets and then did sentiment analysis using python code.The output will be what percentage of people are positive,negative and neutral on the topic.
