# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is used to determine a piece of code whether it is a positive response or negative or neutral. In this project, I requested for Twitter developer account, extracted all the tweets and then did sentiment analysis using python code. The output will be how much percent of people are positive or negative or neutral on the topic.
